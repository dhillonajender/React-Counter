# Getting Started with Counter React App

This project is a simple React application that implements counter and navbar component. The counter allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a numeric value displayed on the screen. The Navbar shows the count of counter used. I used both functional and class based components to understand both types of components. The application is built using the create-react-app boilerplate and includes basic styling using CSS. 



## Available Scripts


In the project directory, you can run:
### `npx create-react-app`
To create the app

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
